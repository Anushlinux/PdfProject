This project creates a Streamlit application named PdfProject that allows users to chat with a Gemini to search and retrieve information from uploaded PDFs.

Features:
    Upload multiple PDFs.
    Ask questions about the content of the PDFs.
    Get answers generated by a powerful LLM using the retrieved information.
    Maintain conversation history for a more natural interaction.
    Clear conversation history with a button (optional).

Technologies Used:
    Streamlit: Web framework for building data apps.
